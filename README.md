## Features

- Simulates the deployment of a circular hoop truss composed of 7R scissor-like units.
- Includes two visualization modes:
  - **Static Mode** â€“ Displays folded, partially deployed, and fully deployed states.
  - **Animation Mode** â€“ Visualizes the continuous deployment process.
- Models core structural components:
  - Upper/lower hoops
  - Vertical members
  - Scissor arms
  - Diagonal cross-bracing
  - Center joints
